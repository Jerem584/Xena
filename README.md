# Xena.
##### UPDATE - January 23rd, 2020:
I wrote Xena because I was curious how game cheats worked. I figured the best way to learn is to write one myself. 
I learned so much about cross platform development, optimizing applications at the garbage collection/jit level
and how different operating systems handle system memory. Sadly I will be archiving this repo. I don't want to 
contribute to the growing amount of cheaters in games. Feel free to use this as an education reference. 

Xena is a CS:GO (Counter Strike Global Offensive) cheat made from scratch written in Java. 
Xena is built from the ground up with garbage-free, high performance, low resource usage programming practices in mind. 

# **Please don't be that idiot who downloads cheats and runs around in public games. You ruin the game for everyone else.**
